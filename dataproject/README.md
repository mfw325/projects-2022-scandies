# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Economic analysis of the US** and is about the developments of some key economic variables in the US: that is the unemployment rate, the GDP growth, the Federal Funds interest rate and the inflation rate.

The **results** of the project can be seen by running the file [dataproject.ipynb]

Our data is imported from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis through an API. We import 4 different timeseries and then merge them into one table.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``!pip install pandas-datareader`` and ``pip install plotly``
